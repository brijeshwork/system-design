# Scalable Notification System Design

## 1. Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Support multiple types of notifications (push, email, SMS, in-app)
- Allow users to manage notification preferences
- Support real-time and batch notifications
- Support templated notifications
- Support prioritization of notifications
- Allow scheduling of notifications

### Non-Functional Requirements
- High availability (99.9%)
- Low latency (< 1s for real-time notifications)
- Scalable to handle millions of notifications per day
- Reliable delivery with retry mechanism
- Message ordering when needed
- Support for multiple geographic regions

## 2. System Architecture

### High-Level Design
```
[Client Apps] -> [API Gateway] -> [Notification Service] -> [Message Queue] -> [Workers] -> [Delivery Services]
                                         ↓                         ↓
                                  [User Service]           [Template Service]
                                  [Database]               [Analytics Service]
```

### Components

#### 2.1 API Gateway
- Entry point for all client requests
- Handles authentication and rate limiting
- Routes requests to appropriate services

#### 2.2 Notification Service
- Core service handling notification logic
- Validates notifications
- Applies user preferences
- Manages notification templates
- Handles notification scheduling

#### 2.3 Message Queue (e.g., Kafka/RabbitMQ)
- Decouples notification processing from delivery
- Ensures reliable message delivery
- Supports multiple consumer groups
- Handles back-pressure

#### 2.4 Worker Services
- Process notifications from queue
- Apply delivery rules and preferences
- Handle retries and failures
- Scale horizontally based on load

#### 2.5 Delivery Services
- Specialized services for each notification type
- Integration with external providers:
  - Push notification services (FCM, APNS)
  - Email service providers
  - SMS gateways
  - In-app notification system

## 3. Data Model

### Users
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR,
    phone VARCHAR,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Notification Preferences
```sql
CREATE TABLE notification_preferences (
    user_id UUID,
    channel_type VARCHAR,
    is_enabled BOOLEAN,
    quiet_hours_start TIME,
    quiet_hours_end TIME,
    PRIMARY KEY (user_id, channel_type)
);
```

### Notifications
```sql
CREATE TABLE notifications (
    notification_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID,
    type VARCHAR,
    template_id UUID,
    content JSONB,
    status VARCHAR,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    scheduled_for TIMESTAMP,
    delivered_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

## 4. Scalability Considerations

### 4.1 Database Sharding
- Shard by user_id
- Separate databases for different regions
- Read replicas for high-traffic queries

### 4.2 Caching Strategy
- Cache user preferences
- Cache notification templates
- Use Redis/Memcached for distributed caching

### 4.3 Load Balancing
- Load balance API Gateway
- Distribute worker loads
- Geographic distribution of services

## 5. Reliability and Fault Tolerance

### 5.1 Retry Mechanism
- Exponential backoff for failed deliveries
- Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) for failed messages
- Circuit breakers for external services

### 5.2 Monitoring and Alerting
- Track delivery success rates
- Monitor queue lengths
- Alert on error thresholds
- Track latency metrics

## 6. Security Considerations

### 6.1 Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- API key management for external services

### 6.2 Data Security
- Encryption at rest
- Encryption in transit (TLS)
- PII data handling compliance

## 7. Analytics and Monitoring

### 7.1 Key Metrics
- Delivery success rate
- Notification engagement rate
- System latency
- Queue depth
- Error rates

### 7.2 Logging
- Structured logging
- Centralized log management
- Audit trails for sensitive operations

## 8. Future Improvements

- Support for more notification channels
- A/B testing capabilities
- Machine learning for optimal delivery timing
- Enhanced personalization
- Cross-device notification sync
- Advanced analytics dashboard

## 9. Capacity Estimation

### 9.1 Traffic Estimates
- Daily active users: 1M
- Average notifications per user per day: 5
- Peak QPS: 1000
- Storage growth: 50GB/month

### 9.2 Resource Requirements
- Message Queue: Kafka cluster with 3-5 brokers
- Databases: Primary with 2 read replicas
- Cache: Redis cluster with 3 nodes
- Workers: Auto-scaling group of 10-20 instances

This design provides a robust foundation for a scalable notification system that can handle millions of notifications while maintaining high availability and reliability.
